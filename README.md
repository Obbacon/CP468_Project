# CP468 Project
Authors - Lily Dinh and Stephen Morris 

# Project Description:

Our objective is to find out how and why the scores from the dataset affects an entrys rank. For exploratory data analysis we will be using R and for the training/testing we will be using Python.  

# Dataset Used:

anime.csv

# Installation and execution steps
Install RStudio, R, and the following libraries: dplyr, GGally, reshape2, ggplot2, scales

Install Python, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, nltk and turtle

# Performance parameters
Prediction Accuracy - the accuracy of the prediction compare to actual values, the closer to 100% the better the precition

Mean Absolute Error -  the difference between the prediction of an observation and the true value of that observation, best value is 0.0

Explained Variance Score - the variability of the prediction of the models, best possible score is 1.0, any lower values are worse
